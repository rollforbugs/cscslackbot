CSC Slack Bot
=============
This is a Slack bot for the Wright State University Cybersecurity Club.

Setup
-----
To run the bot, set up a Python virtual environment with
```bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
or
```bash
virtualenv env
env/bin/activate.sh
```
depending on your platform.
Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Style Guidelines
----------------
Please try to write code to remain compatible with Python 3 as best you can.
Make sure to `from __future__ import unicode_literals` and use parentheses
around calls to the `print` function.

Officially, this is based on Python 2, but if compatibility is possible, it
should be embraced.
